### Welcome to Simply Maple
Simply Maple is a Website/CMS for MapleStory. Our goal with this website is to create a new generation of MapleStory websites, for instance, this website is based off of the Metro theme, but edited to our liking, our design is mainly for the use of "Flat UI Colors", no 3D images, or anything special, just a very simplistic looking website. The website was coded in PHP, HTML5, CSS3, and some JS. Our main goal is just to make a very responsive website, there is not going to be any use of bootstrap nor Metro UI.

### The Design
The design uses 100% CSS3, there are no images besides the background image. (That may change in the future). Our main goal is to make a flat, simplistic looking website, and make it look good at the same time. We use an opacity of "0.8" for each of the main containers (Navbar/Header, Body/Base, and Footer). There may be sidebars in the future.

### The Code
The code is quite simple, just a very efficient use of PHP and HTML, along with CSS (we don't count css as code really because it's very simple). Our main goal of the code was to use the following for our pages, which makes it include our header/navbar, our footer, and our base/body:

### The Team
The team is quite small, well, it's only one person, and that's Hexish/SilentThief. He is the creator of this website. This is a solo development at the time, but may hire others to have small parts in this creation, this will not be a paying job.
